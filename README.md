# Introduction

The purpose of this project was to create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
I have built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

- Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

# Observations

- From the latitude vs. longtitude plot, we can conclude that as we approach the equator the weather becomes warmer. It is also important to note that there is a wider range of temperature differences for cities that are in the lower hemisphere.
- From the latitude vs. humidity plot, we can conclude that there is no strong correlation.
- From the latitude vs. cloudiness plot, we can conclude that there is no strong correlation.
- IFrom the latitude vs. windiness plot, we can conclude that there is no strong correlation.
